# Live Signature Detection System

## üöÄ Project Overview  
The **Live Signature Detection System** is a Python-based application that validates handwritten signatures using OpenCV's ORB algorithm. It features signature registration, validation, and an interactive GUI.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run the Project  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:  

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramnaresh-ahi/Live-Signature-Detection-System.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Live-Signature-Detection-System


3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main application script: 
python main.py


I see now! You want the instructions to run the project, contribute, and other steps directly translated into GitHub-flavored commands for your README.md file. Here's the updated version with everything framed in the form of GitHub commands:

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python for programming.
Libraries:
OpenCV for image processing and signature comparison.
Pillow (PIL) for image manipulation.
Tkinter for GUI development.
Pickle for data serialization.
Algorithm: ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) for feature matching.

üåü Future Enhancements
We plan to add:

1. Database Integration:
Replace pickle with SQLite or MongoDB for secure data storage.

2. Deep Learning Integration:
Incorporate deep learning models for enhanced signature validation.

4. Web Version:
Develop a web-based version for improved accessibility.
