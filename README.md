# Add the project overview section
echo -e "\n## 🚀 Project Overview\nThe **Live Signature Detection System** is a Python-based application that validates handwritten signatures using OpenCV's ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm. The system allows users to register their signature and validate future signatures by comparing them to the stored ones. It features signature registration, validation, and an interactive GUI." >> README.md
