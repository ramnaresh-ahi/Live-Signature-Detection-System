# Live Signature Detection System

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The **Live Signature Detection System** is a Python-based application that validates handwritten signatures using OpenCV's ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm. The system allows users to register their signature and validate future signatures by comparing them to the stored ones. It features signature registration, validation, and an interactive GUI.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Python** for programming.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **OpenCV** for image processing and signature comparison.  
  - **Pillow (PIL)** for advanced image handling.  
  - **Tkinter** for building the graphical user interface (GUI).  
  - **Pickle** for data serialization.  
- **Algorithm**:  
  - **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)** for feature matching and signature validation.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements  

Future features and improvements include:

- **Database Integration**:  
  Replace **Pickle** with **SQLite** or **MongoDB** to improve data storage and security.
  
- **Deep Learning Models**:  
  Integrate deep learning models for more accurate and robust signature validation.

- **Web Version**:  
  Develop a web-based version of the application for increased accessibility.
